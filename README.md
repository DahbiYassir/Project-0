# Project-0
Hi there,
My name is yassir and i am an engineering student in the national school of applied sciences in marrakech city Morocco,
Also i am a president of a judo association founded by my dad in 1998, so that's why i decided to make a website for our club.
For now it still an incomplete website but i guess it veryfies all the conditions of Project 0.
Thank you !
